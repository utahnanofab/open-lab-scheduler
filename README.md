# Open Lab Scheduler

Here at the Utah Nanofab, we are investigating our options for our next lab management software.  
We would like our next system to be an open source solution so that we can share and
collaborate with other Universities and institutions.

This repository is our starting point for opening a discussion to see if there are 
others who are interested in creating something together.  We would like to see if 
there is an existing code base that could work as a starting point for this project--either
one that is already open source, or one whose maintainers would be willing to change
to an open source license.  If we can't find a suitable code base as a starting point,
we would like to build one.

In the docs folder of this repo, we will add some of the specifications for this project.

Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests to join the discussion.
